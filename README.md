# Anymous_authentication
User onetime anymously authenticating system

============   Onetime automatic anymous authentication for firebase  ========================

Features:- 

1.One single app user authenticated for only one time during users app lifetime. (using onAuth )

2.No signin button, automatically sign in anymous users( very fast) with loading text on screen (visible only for first time app open).



# !!!NOTE!!!

# See my second project , In there i add network connectivity + anymous authentication
Because this will give continous loading screen if there were no internet connection.
